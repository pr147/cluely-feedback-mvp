# Cluely Feedback Intelligence MVP ðŸ’¡

A fast, focused MVP built from scratch to answer one question:

> "What are Cluely's users really saying â€” and what should be done about it?"

I pulled together 50+ raw Reddit comments and turned them into structured insight cards, clear charts, and a punchy roadmap. All signal, no fluff.

ðŸŽ¯ **Live dashboard**:

## ðŸ“Š What's Inside

- Tagged insights by theme: Friction, Delight, Requests, Use-cases
- Bar + pie charts showing what matters most to users
- Product/UX recommendations based on real pain points
- A 90-day roadmap grounded in user sentiment, not guesswork

## ðŸ›  Why I Made This

Cluely is bold â€” so I wanted to respond in kind.

Rather than just send a resume, I listened to users. Then I built something that translates their voices into strategy â€” fast, useful, and founder-readable.

This is how I think. This is how I work.

## âš¡ Final Note

If this dashboard made you pause â€” even for a second â€” then it did its job.

I didnâ€™t build it because I had to. I built it because it felt obvious that someone should.

If you want more work like this â€” fast, thoughtful, and user-first â€” Iâ€™d love to help build it with you.
